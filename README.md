## The Infinite 'Unsquare' Well: Solving the 1D Schrödinger Equation using Numerical Methods

An IPython notebook I created for my second year scientific computing course, PHAS2130, demonstrating the use of Runge-Kutta methods in solving Schrödinger's equation for a number of simple systems. 

Visualisation with matplotlib.
